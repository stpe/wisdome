# Wisdome Hackathon March 26th 2024

This repository contain the source of some JavaScript/Canvas based graphical effects I experimented with during the [Wisdome](https://www.tekniskamuseet.se/en/wisdome/) Hackathon (March 26th, 2024). Using a 1:1 browser window with [OBS](https://obsproject.com/) the effects could be streamed using [Resolume](https://www.resolume.com/) and then splitted to the six 8K laser projectors inside the spherical dome.
